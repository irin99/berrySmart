Farming accounts for 70% of the world’s water consumption, with many over watering their crops, while one-fifth of the world's population lacks safe drinking water. This issue primarily stems from a lack of understanding of what individual plants require in terms of water, fertilizer, sunlight and pesticides. 

The berrySmart device gives farmers a way to better understand their farm. A variety of sensors are strategically placed across the farm, the values of which are POSTed to a central database. We then create a dashboard for farmers that highlight these sensor values along with recommendations based off of them.

This project uses various sensors (soil moisture, temperature, light, humidity) placed in three high priority areas in the farm. Working as nodes in a WiFi overlayed mesh network, each node communicates the location’s data to a central database. The central databases’ data is then analyzed on a dashboard accessible to farmers.
